# 🎮 aimnetv2 – AI Fortnite 1v1 Learning

**aimnetv2** is a personal project aiming to develop an artificial intelligence capable of learning Fortnite 1v1 mechanics by observing real players and then improving through self-play reinforcement learning.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

The mission is to build an AI that can:

- 🧠 Learn advanced Fortnite mechanics (edits, builds, aim...) from real gameplay
- 📈 Improve by training against itself (AI vs AI self-play)
- 🤖 Simulate human-like decisions in competitive 1v1 scenarios

---

## 🧩 What's already done

- ✅ Full keyboard/mouse input logging (`inputs.txt`)
- ✅ 1v1 gameplay recordings with OBS
- ✅ Inputs displayed in sync with gameplay
- ✅ First logs structured as clean, timestamped data for AI training

---

## 📦 Sample input log

Example of `inputs.txt` data:

2025-07-14 15:23:01.123 | KEY_PRESS | w
2025-07-14 15:23:01.456 | MOUSE_DOWN | Button.left | x:1250 | y:710
2025-07-14 15:23:01.720 | KEY_PRESS | space


This allows us to transform gameplay into data readable by machine learning models.

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps

- 🔄 Synchronize dual-player logs (inputs + positions)
- 📚 Build the first training dataset
- 🤖 Develop a simple prototype AI for 1v1 situations
- 📹 Launch a public demo video to attract collaborators & supporters

---

## 🤝 Looking for contributors

I’m currently looking for:

- 👨‍💻 AI / Reinforcement Learning developers
- 🎮 Pro/semi-pro players willing to share POV + logs
- 💰 Funding to build the first prototype (~€800 target)

## 👤 About me

I’m Quentin, a Fortnite player passionate about both competitive mechanics and AI systems.  
I started this project to explore how far an AI can go when trained like a human player — with real input data and thousands of 1v1s.
