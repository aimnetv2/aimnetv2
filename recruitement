# 🤖 AI Developer Wanted – Phase 1 (Supervised Learning)

**Project:** aimnetv2 – Teaching an AI to learn Fortnite 1v1 mechanics by watching pro players.

## 📌 Phase 1 – Learn by Watching

The goal of this phase is to train an AI model to understand and reproduce Fortnite gameplay actions by analyzing:

- Pro 1v1 footage (POV recordings)
- Corresponding keyboard/mouse input logs (`fortbot_inputs_log.txt`)
- Timestamps to synchronize actions and game states

We already have:
- A sample demo and GitHub project initialized
- Plans for scaling to self-play in Phase 2

## 🔍 Looking for someone who can:

- Build a supervised learning model that maps **inputs to screen behavior**
- Train on labeled data (key presses, mouse events, POV footage)
- Handle time-series data (RNNs, Transformers, CNN+LSTM...)
- Prototype with PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras
- Output predictions of action sequences based on visual + input context

> The model doesn’t need to control the game yet — just learn to **understand and imitate** what a pro player is doing from video + logs.

## 🧠 Tools / Stack

- Python (Jupyter or scripts)
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
- OpenCV (optional, for frame analysis)
- Dataset: `inputs_log.txt` + screen capture
- Possible modeling: action prediction, behavior cloning

# 🧱 Unreal Engine 5 Developer Wanted – aimnetv2 Project (for the future) 

**Project:** aimnetv2 – A Fortnite-style AI agent that learns mechanics through observation and self-play.

## 🎯 Objective

We are developing an AI that learns Fortnite 1v1 mechanics by watching pro gameplay and then improves by fighting itself in a custom environment.

for the futur we are gonna enter in the **Phase 2**: building an **Unreal Engine 5 simulation** where the AI can train via self-play (1v1 vs itself) in a Fortnite-inspired arena.

## 🛠️ What we need

- A simplified training arena (walls, ramps, edits, shot simulation)
- AI-bot input integration (keyboard/mouse emulation or event triggers)
- Optimization for **50+ concurrent AI matches**
- Sync with external input/output logs for reinforcement learning

## 💡 References

- OpenAI Five-like environments  
- OpenGym / RLlib integrations  
- Multi-agent sandboxing with reward functions
